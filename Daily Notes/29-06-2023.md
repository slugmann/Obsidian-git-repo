## Zettelkasten
**Original:**
1. Fleeting note - Rough and raw, like scrap paper and pen
2. Literature Note - Notes for research - lots of info - articles, books, uni notes, ect
3. Permanent Note - A concept summarised

**Updated:**
1. **Daily Note** - Rough notes for taking general info, short term - good for putting thoughts away
2. **Literature Note** - All detail (uni slides) and all info required - For collection
3. **Distilled Notes** - Concepts summarised in a sentence or paragraph - Its ok to have a lot of these. Memory is cheap but brainspace is not - Use these to link and build, these are our building blocks
