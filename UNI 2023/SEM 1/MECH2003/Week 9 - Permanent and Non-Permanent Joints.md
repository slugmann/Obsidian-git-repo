# Bolts VS Screws
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522103616.png]]
A bolt is a fastener that is tightened through the use of a nut. A screw is tightened from the head and tightened by the thread in a hole. 

Both screws and bolts operate in the same manner. They have torque applied to them such that the bolt or screw is placed under tension. The tension in the bolt/screw clamps the first component applying a compressive force, increasing the friction force between the two objects. 
A bolt does not prevent the two components from moving relative to each other directly. The clamping action which increases the friction between the two allows a stronger joint in shear to be achieved.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522103938.png]]
As a result, the shank of a screw or bolt must have clearance through the component being clamped. and only be fixed to the far component threads.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522104359.png]]
Bolts can clamp several components together so long as clearance is allowed.

# Head Geometry
Screws and bolts come with a variety of different heads depending on the finish required and tools available to apply the necessary torque.

## Cap/Hex Head and Domed/Mushroom
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522104707.png]]
Cap head (Left) and Domed/Mushroom (Right) head screws can have torque applied through the use of Allan keys. They include a hexagonal recess to insert the Allan key into.

Hex head, cap head, and domed/mushroom head screws all protrude above the surface they are bolting against in an assembly.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522105036.png]]
**Countersunk** screws fasten against a countersunk hole providing a flush finish. This is only possible when the material is adequately thick enough to accommodate the head. This is only possible where the material is adequately thick.

![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522105448.png]]

Countersunk screws can have a variety of different recesses to accommodate different tools.

# Screw/Bolt Dimensions
There are several key dimensions
- Diameter
- Length
- Thread pitch and type

The **diameter** of a screw or bolt is specified by the nominal size hole that it will fit into. An M8 screw will fit in an 8mm diameter hole, but it is unlikely that any section of the screw or bolt will have that dimension.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522105840.png]]

The length of a screw or bolt is an indication of the combined thickness that the component is required to assemble.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522105924.png]]
For this reason, the length is specific to the type of head being used. For **countersunk** screws and bolts, the length is specified as the overall length.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522110030.png]]
For all other screws and bolts, the length is measured from the base of the head regardless of what head type it may be.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522110223.png]]

When selecting screws and bolts, be certain that the length is sufficient to also include the necessary washers and nuts. At least two turns of thread should be exposed past the nut once assembly is complete.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522110337.png]]
Metric screws and bolts are available with two different thread sizes, either coarse or fine. Fine threads are typically only available for diameters greater than M6.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522110445.png]]
Imperial screws and bolts have a larger variety of threads and great care must be taken that the correct thread is selected.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522110536.png]]

## Measuring Thread
Thread gauges are used to determine this, they should be located against the screw to ensure the pitch is correct.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522110803.png]]

# Nuts

## Hex Nuts
The most common nut to use is hexagonal in shape and approximately 0.8 times the diameter of a bolt (height not diameter). A half nut may also be used as security which usually has a height of 0.5 times.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522111033.png]]

## Wing Nuts
Wing nuts provide an option that can be tightened or loosened by hand. They do not allow for the same amount of tension to be applied to the bolt for this reason.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522111154.png]]

## Lock Nuts (Nylock nuts)
Nylock nuts (Lock nuts) use a ring of plastic at one end which is cut into by the bolt thread, preventing it from loosening. Nylocks should only be used once.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522111308.png]]

## Castle Nuts
Castle nuts are designed to be used with locking wire or split pins. The locking wire / split pins ensure the nut cannot come loose without cutting and removing the wire.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522111407.png]]

# Washers
Washers are used to spread the compressive load supplied by the bolt and prevent the component that is being clamped from being damaged. They can also be used as spacers.

## Spring Washers
Spring washers assist with preventing a nut and bolt from loosening by constantly applying a force that increases the friction between bolt and nut thread. More or less they're like a small spring between the nut and the material.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522111751.png]]

# Rivets
Rivets provide a permanent joint that acts in a similar way to a bolt or screw. The tension in a rivet increases the friction between the two components, restricting movement in the shear direction. Rivets have a head on one side before they are affixed, the second head is often formed through cold working or heating the rivet and hammering it flat to form another head.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522112133.png]]
Rivets are cheap to manufacture, but take increased labour to install. They have fallen out of favour as things become cheaper and easier to manufacture and labour costs increase.

## Solid Rivets
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522112356.png]]
Solid rivets have been used in the construction of the Harbor Bridge, Golden Gate Bridge, and many other large steel structures

They require compression in order to form a secondary head and apply a compressive force to the two components being assembled.

When used in large steel structures (requiring large rivets) solid rivets were heated prior to installation, assisting with forming the second head and increasing the compression force once cooled. Workers used to throw red hot rivets to each other during construction, catching them with heat resistant gloves or with tools.

## Semi-Tubular Rivets 
Semi-Tubular rivets have material removed from the end of the shank to reduce the pressure required to form the second head. **This is typically a quarter of the force required for similar solid rivets.**
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522113036.png]]

## Blind Rivets (Pop Rivets)
The installation of Blind Rivets naturally apply tension in the fastener without having to apply any heating. They only require access to one side (hence blind) and also offer greater flexibility in the size of components assembled. These are the kind of rivets you use with a pop rivet gun.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522113312.png]]

## Rivet Selection
When selecting any rivet, it is necessary to specify the diameter, the grip range (length), the head type and material required to apply the required tension.

# Welding
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522115530.png]]
Two components are locally heated to the point that the material they are made of melt and fuse together once cooled.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522114201.png]]
Historically its only been done with metals, although welding can be applied to plastic and composites.

Types include:
- Stick Welding
- MIG Welding (Metal Inert Gas)
- TIG Welding (Tungsten Inert Gas)
- Spot Welding
- Oxy-Acetylene Welding 

## Stick Welding
Utilises a sacrificial stick which has the same composition as the parent material being welded. Large currents are passed through the stick to the region being welded to melt the material. Requires decent skill and technique to get right.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522114657.png]]
As welding is conducted the stick is consumed, depositing itself into the final weld. As a result, the operator is required to move the electrode closer to the region as the weld progresses.

The external coating of the stick (electrode) when melted generates a gas that prevents impurities entering the final weld and compromising its mechanical properties.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522114910.png]]

## MIG Welding
MIG welding differs in that a wire, which acts as an electrode, is constantly fed to the region being welded by the weld head. An inert gas is also fed into the region surrounding the wire ensuring the weld is not mechanically compromised by impurities (Lack if oxygen means no oxidization).
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522120438.png]]

## TIG Welding
TIG Welding uses a tungsten electrode that is only used to create the arc which melts the material. An inert gas is also introduced from the electrode holder.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522120548.png]]
The operator is required to feed the wire into the region by hand to contribute material to the weld. The use of a semi permanent electrode offers the most concentrated heating source, making it ideal for detailed work.

## Spot Welding
Spot welding utilises electrodes that clamp two pieces of material together and pass large currents between them, melting them where they're clamped. This is commonly used in automated mass production with components made of sheet metal.

## Oxy Acetylene Welding
Utilises an ignited gas to heat the filler material and the adjacent parent material in order to achieve a weld.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522123542.png]]
Electricity isn't required for this process as the torch is fed by an oxygen acetylene mix that is pressurised and ignited.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522123646.png]]
This process is most suitable for remote locations, and even allows for **underwater welding**.
If you're comfortable with high currents in a conductive fluid, stick welding is also a possibility. (Should be safe so long as voltage is low enough and DC power is used)

## Weld Types
**Bead, fillet, plug, or groove** welds are names that describe their location on a component.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522123910.png]]

## Consequences of Welding
As part has undergone heating and cooling, the geometry of the part may be warped. This can make it difficult to achieve necessary tolerances. Jigs and clamps are often used to minimise the effects of warp.

# Bonded Joints
Include:
- Brazing
- Soldering
- Cementing

## Brazing
Two different materials are joined using a third material that has been heated to fill the gap between the two components utilising capillary action (material flows to fill the space like water would accumulate in crevices). This provides a very smooth/neat finish.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522124247.png]]
The components are heated to temperatures greater than $427 \degree C$ (800F) using either a furnace or a high temp flame to melt the third material and allow capillary action to occur.

## Soldering
Soldering is similar to brazing but occurs at temps less than $426 \degree C$. Joints using this technique should ensure the parent material take all the loads. Load bearing solder is an option, however it isn't very strong and is harder to work with. This is typically used for electrical components.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522124538.png]]
## Cementing
Cementing is a fancy word for adhesive. Adhesives offer advantages over fasteners in that they provide much more distributed loads.
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230522124646.png]]
Most adhesives remain inert until some curing process activates the adhesive. These processes may include:
- Anaerobic Curing - Contact with metal surfaces and absence of oxygen between them
- Heating
- Interaction - Two part epoxy or mixing an adhesive with a primer
- Solvent evaporation
- Ultraviolet Light
