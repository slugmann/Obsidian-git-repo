# Role of a Spring
- **Store Mechanical Energy:** For this reason mechanical watches using torsional springs. By winding the watch you store energy in the spring which is released over time.
- **Provide Force:** Helical extension springs are used to provide a force which will eject toast from a toaster
- **Reduce Impulse:** We see this in the use of suspension members. A spring allows the impulse to be stretched over a period of time and reduce impulse force.

# Types of Springs
![Pasted image 20230607191214](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607191214.png)
Springs can be catagorized into three groups. They all work in using the same principles.

## Helical Springs
The most common spring, also known as **coil** springs. They are predominantly cylindrical in shape and consist of a constant diameter wire. (Not identical in cross sectional diameter, but in thickness of the wire itself.
![Pasted image 20230607191428](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607191428.png)
These come in two different forms depending on the direction they are loaded. 
- If placed in tension, **helical extension** springs are more suitable. 
- If the most frequent load will cause compression, then **helical compression** springs would be required.

## Torsional Springs
Space constraints and/or the desire to produce torque make **torsional springs** more suitable in some applications. Torsional springs store energy by being twisted about a central axis.
![Pasted image 20230607191748](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607191748.png)
Torsional springs can utilise either rectangular or circular cross sections depending on the desired stiffness and anticipated deflection.

## Flat Springs
Like other springs, **flat springs** store and release energy in response to an external load. They are typically manufactured by flat pieces of metal that have been stamped.
![|500](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607192032.png)
### Leaf Springs
A type of flat spring. These springs are unique as when they are used in a multi leaf configuration, the friction between the multiple flat springs sliding over each other provides damping.
![|800](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607192208.png)

### Spring Washers
Another type of flat spring. These store energy when a nut is tightened against a bolt, providing load. This adds friction to the assembly which prevents the nut and bolt from coming loose.

# Specifying Springs

## Helical Springs
To specify a compression helical spring, you must indicate:
- The spring stiffness required. This is defined by the nominal diameter, the wire material, and wire diameter
- Length of the spring (without load)
![Pasted image 20230607192616](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607192616.png)
- Type of end that is required (plain end, squared end, closed end)
- Direction the spring is wound (left or right handed)
![Pasted image 20230607192725](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607192725.png)
- The type of end that is required (Machine half loop, raised hook, short twisted loop, full twisted loop)
![|600](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607192908.png)
![|600](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607192752.png)

## Torsional Springs
To specify a torsional spring, you must indicate:
- The spring stiffness required. This is defined by spring nominal diameter, wire material, and wire diameter
- Body length of spring desired.
![|700](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607193058.png)
- The type of end that is required (axial, tangential radial, and the angle between ends.
- Direction that the spring is wound (left or right handed)

# Manufacturing
Springs are made from a wire wound about a mandrel with some tension. This can be done **hot or cold**.

# Calculations
Force that a spring provides is proportional and relative to its deflection. With no deflection, the spring provides no force, but as it is compressed/stretched/rotated, the force that it provides increases.
![Pasted image 20230607193932](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607193932.png)
The rate with which the spring force increases with deflection is known as the **spring coefficient**. The stiffer the spring, the higher the spring coefficient.
![Pasted image 20230607194041](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607194041.png)

While keeping all other parameters equal, a spring can be made stiffer by:
- Increasing the wire diameter
- Reducing the mean spring diameter
- Increasing the pitch (for a compression helical spring)
A deflected spring stores energy. The amount of energy that is stored is proportional to the spring coefficient and the displacement squared. Therefore, **every time you double the spring deflection, you quadruple the potential energy it is stored.**
![Pasted image 20230607195719](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607195719.png)
The energy can be stored by a spring also increases with the **spring coefficient**. The stiffer the spring, the more energy can be stored at a given deflection.

## Examples
![Pasted image 20230607200024](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607200024.png)
![Pasted image 20230607200040](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607200040.png)
![Pasted image 20230607200053](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607200053.png)

## Forces and Force Diagrams
Consider a mass (m) hung from a spring. When at rest $F_{spring}$ and $mg$ are balanced.
![Pasted image 20230607200922](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607200922.png)
Now what would happen if the mass was excited by an additional temporary force acting down ($F_{excite}$).
![Pasted image 20230607201026](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607201026.png)
The excitation will result in the spring extending. Once fully extended, the potential energy in the spring will return a force. Because of the additional spring extension, the force $F_{spring}$ is now greater than the weight ($mg$) resulting in the object being accelerated into the opposite direction.

All the potential energy in the spring is consumed and instead the mass now has the potential energy. At this point there is no spring force and the weight of the mass will cause it to begin falling again.

This initiates the process again causing the spring to deflect, and once again, store the energy in the spring.

This results in an oscillating motion which, when neglecting friction or gravity, will never stop. This is undesirable for most mechanical systems.
![Pasted image 20230607201543](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607201543.png)
 For this reason springs are usually coupled with dampers as they provide a force that is proportional to the speed of a piston through a fluid.
 ![Pasted image 20230607201629](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607201629.png)
This dampens the motion, and allows excited mass to come to rest again. Without damping the spring and mass would oscillate indefinitely (or at least for a while)
![Pasted image 20230607201757](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607201757.png)

## Impulse
Springs reduce the force experienced at any moment in time by increasing the duration that an impulse is transferred with. An impulse is the multiple of force and time.
$$I = \Delta mv = Ft$$
Where:
$I$ = Impulse (Ns)
$m$ = Mass (kg)
$v$ = Velocity (m/s)
$F$ = Force (N)
$t$ = Time (s)

## Stress
The maximum stress in a wire of a helical spring can be determined by cutting a spring, and at the cut cross section considering the internal forces/moments to determine the shear force and torsional moment. This reduces to be:
![Pasted image 20230607202606](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607202606.png)
$$\tau_{max} = \frac{8FD}{\pi d^{3}}+\frac{4F}{\pi d^{2}}$$
Where:
$F$ = Spring Force (N)
$D$ = Spring mean diameter (m)
$d$ = Wire diameter (m)

## Spring Index and Stress
The spring index (C) is the ratio of the spring mean diameter to the wire diameter. Where $K_{s}$ is the shear stress correction factor. Both are defined below:
$$C = \frac{D}{d}$$
$$K_{s} = \frac{2C + 1}{2C}$$
The stress in the spring reduces to be:
$$\tau = K_{s}\frac{8FD}{\pi d^{3}}$$

## Deflection-Force Relationship
The deflection-force relationship can be obtained considering the total strain energy. For a helical spring, this is composed of a torsional and shear component. This allows the spring rate, also known as the spring scale, to be determined as:
$$k = \frac{d^{4}G}{8D^{3}N_{a}}$$
Where:
$G$ = Shear Modulus (Pa)
$N_{a}$ = Number of active coils
![Pasted image 20230607203818](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607203818.png)

## Buckling
When the load on a compression spring becomes too large, it will buckle. This compromises the springs ability to carry a load (obviously), therefore it is necessary to determine when this will occur. This is the same as determining of the spring is stable. For steel springs, this occurs when:
$$L_{0}<2.63 \frac{D}{\alpha}$$
![Pasted image 20230607204045](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230607204045.png)

## Tensile Strength of Spring Materials
Tensile strength varies with wire size, the process it undergoes and the material used. The tensile strength of spring materials relative to wire diameter can be represented by.
$$S_{ut}= \frac{A}{d^{m}}$$
