​￼￼￼Sensors
There are a number of sensors for measuring real world parameters relative to mechatronics.

- Internal sensors (Dead-reckoning)
- Speed measurement – Tacho-generator, encoder
- Current measurement
– Wheel Encoders, Odometry
– Accelerometers (spring-mounted masses)
– Gyroscopes (spinning mass, laser light)
– Compasses, inclinometers (earth magnetic field, gravity)
​￼​￼• ￼￼Proximity sensors￼￼
	- Ultrasound
	- Sonar (time of flight) (SOund Navigation And Ranging)
	- Radar (phase and frequency) (RAdio Detection And Ranging)
	- LIDAR, Laser range-finders (triangulation, ToF, phase) (LIght Detection And Ranging)
	- Infrared (intensity)
• ￼￼Visual sensors: Cameras￼￼

• Satellite-based sensors: GPS
