## Fundamental Laws of Hydraulics
- When a force (F) is applied to an area (A) of an enclosed liquid, a pressure (P) is produced.
$$\text{Pressure} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Area}}$$

Can be quoted in Bar, pounds per square inch (PSI) or Pascal (Pa)
For SI units:
**Force** in Newtons (N)
**Area** is in square meters ($m^{2}$)

1 Pascal = 1N/m^3
1 Bar = 100,000 Pa = 10^5

### [[Pascal's Law]]
*The pressure in a confined fluid is transmitted equally to the whole surface of its container.*



# Conceptual Info

## Intro
- **Fluid Power** is the method of using pressurized fluid or gas to transmit energy
- Liquid and gas are both referred to as fluid. These are broken down into **Pneumatics** and **Hydraulics** respectively

- Air is **compressible**
- Liquid is **incompressible**

Used commonly where mechanisms require large forces and precise control
