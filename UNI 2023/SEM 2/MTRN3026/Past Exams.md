**Question 6**    Describe the importance of transformer in our society.
With the instruments located on the high-voltage side and with the low-voltage side short-circuited, the short-circuit test readings for a 40-kVA 2300:230-V transformer are 48 V, 20.8 A, and 617 W. An open-circuit test with the low-voltage side energized gives instrument readings on that side of 230 V, 5.41 A, and 186 W.
Calculate the equivalent circuit parameters of the transformer.
Draw the equivalent circuit.
Determine the efficiency of the transformer operating at full load, 0.85 power factor lagging.

**Question 7**    Draw the per-phase equivalent circuit of an induction motor and label the different components.
With the help of a proper diagram explain the operation of VSI fed induction motor.
Assuming the motor has a Star (Y) connected winding, draw the waveforms of line voltages and phase voltages for 180o conduction of each switch.
Consider a 50 Hz, single phase induction motor with the following nameplate information: 2.5 kW, 1425 rpm, 230 V, 17.5A, Full load efficiency of 72%. The mechanical losses is 150 W.  Find the output torque, the power factor and cost of running the motor per day if electricity cost 27 cents per kWh.
