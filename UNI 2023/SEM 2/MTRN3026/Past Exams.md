**Question 6**    Describe the importance of transformer in our society.
With the instruments located on the high-voltage side and with the low-voltage side short-circuited, the short-circuit test readings for a 40-kVA 2300:230-V transformer are 48 V, 20.8 A, and 617 W. An open-circuit test with the low-voltage side energized gives instrument readings on that side of 230 V, 5.41 A, and 186 W.
