# Carwash

## Operating Principle
1.Car Entry and Elevation: The car is driven onto a conveyor and into the bay. It is then lifted using either a conventional lift mechanism or modern pressure cylinders, allowing washing and sprinkling devices to reach it.

2.Detergent Application: Solenoid valves are programmed to open at specific intervals. They release detergent water at the optimal pressure to wash away dirt and grime.

3.Brushing and Sprinkling: Brushes are used to clean the car while the sprinkler system washes it through solenoids and nozzles. This ensures a thorough cleanse.

4.Drying: After the washing cycles are completed, air dryers are used to remove moisture from the car, preparing it for delivery.
