## Thevenin's Theorem
"Any combination of voltage sources and resistors with two terminals can be replaced by a single voltage source and a single series resistor."

We can find this equivalent by:
1. Calculate the **open circuit voltage** and the **short-circuit current** of Circuit A.
2. Then calculate Thevenin resistance as: $R_{t}=\frac{v_{oc}}{i_{sc}}$
(Can be done with $R_{t}$ and $v_{oc}$ only

## Amplifiers
Signal gain can be achieved and expressed through voltage, current, or power.

Gain is a ratio, expressed as dimensionless, or V/V, A/A etc. Engineers often express gain logarithmically.
