## Advantages and Disadvantages
**Advantages:**
- Storage allows using electricity at a different time that when it was generated
- Using your own (stored) energy when electricity from the grid is expensive
- Support grid stability (Frequency reg)
**Disadvantages:**
- Some energy is lost due to inefficiencies
- Additional investment costs
- Safety requirement (fire hazard)


## Electrochemical Cells
### Terminology
-  **Electrochemistry** is a branch of chemistry dealing with the *conversion of chemical energy into electricity and vice versa* Energy conversion occurs through reduction-oxidation Redox reactions inside electrochemical cells
	- **Oxidation:** Loss of electrons (anode)
	- **Reduction:** Acquisition of electrons (cathode)
- Types of electrochemical cells:
	- *Galvanic:* Chemical energy --> electricity (dry cells, Pb Acid, Ni-Cd)
	- *Electrolytic:* Electricity -->

## South Australia Hornsdale Power Reserve

Rated at 100 MW/129MWh, it was the largest Li-Ion battery in the world at time of installation. When at peak output, can provide enough electricity to power the equivalent of 45,000 homes.

## Storage of Compound intermittency of renewable sources
*PV Energy*
Solar power generation and load demand for a South Australian home.

Notice the peak load and peak generation do not line up.

*Wind energy*

Another case of peak demand not meeting peak production

## Energy Storage Locations

**Pumped hydro:** Large amounts of water are pumped to a large reservoir in a high location during low power demand periods using renewable or non renewable sources (depending on renewable effectiveness). When power demand peaks the water is released through a turbine into a lower reservoir, generating energy. 
Essentially the water acts as a large battery that is recharged in downtime.
