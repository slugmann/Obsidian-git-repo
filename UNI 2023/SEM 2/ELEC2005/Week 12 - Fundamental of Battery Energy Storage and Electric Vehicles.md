## Electrochem energy: Key Attributes

- **Energy Density:** Energy stored per unit of mass volume, in $Wh/kg$ or $Wh/m^3$
- **Power Density:** Max rate of energy discharge per unit mass or volume in $W/kg$ or $W/m^3$
- **Capacity:** Amount of charge deliverable by a battery in a discharge cycle in $Ah$
- **Life:** number of discharge/recharge cycles at the rated capacity
- **Electrical Efficiency:** Ratio of the energy required to charge a battery compared to the available energy during discharge is the efficiency. (Approx 95% for Li-Ion, 75% for Lead Acid
- **Safety:** Behaviour at high temp (fire risk)
- **Cost**

## Advantages and Disadvantages
**Advantages:**
- Storage allows using electricity at a different time that when it was generated
- Using your own (stored) energy when electricity from the grid is expensive
- Support grid stability (Frequency reg)
**Disadvantages:**
- Some energy is lost due to inefficiencies
- Additional investment costs
- Safety requirement (fire hazard)


## Electrochemical Cells
### Terminology
-  **Electrochemistry** is a branch of chemistry dealing with the *conversion of chemical energy into electricity and vice versa* Energy conversion occurs through reduction-oxidation Redox reactions inside electrochemical cells
	- **Oxidation:** Loss of electrons (anode)
	- **Reduction:** Acquisition of electrons (cathode)
- Types of electrochemical cells:
	- *Galvanic:* Chemical energy --> Electricity (dry cells, Pb Acid, Ni-Cd)
	- *Electrolytic:* Electricity --> Chemical energy (Nelson's cell, Down's Cell)
- An electrochemical cell is typically formed by **two electronic conductors (electrodes)** and **one proton conductor (electrolyte)**

## Galvanic Cells

### Primary Cells
*Conversion of chemical energy into electricity is not reversible (non rechargeable cells/batteries)*

**Deniell's Cell Principle (1836)**

### Secondary Cells
*Conversion of chemical energy into electricity is reversible (rechargeable cells/batteries)*

- Electrochemical **reactions are reversible**: chemical energy <--> electricity
- After cell is discharged, an **external electrical force is applied to reverse the flow of electrons** and re-establish the charged condition
- One discharge and charge operation is called a **cycle**
- A secondary cell can endure **hundreds or thousands** of charge/discharge cycles before losing original properties.

## South Australia Hornsdale Power Reserve

Rated at 100 MW/129MWh, it was the largest Li-Ion battery in the world at time of installation. When at peak output, can provide enough electricity to power the equivalent of 45,000 homes.

## Storage of Compound intermittency of renewable sources
*PV Energy*
Solar power generation and load demand for a South Australian home.

Notice the peak load and peak generation do not line up.

*Wind energy*

Another case of peak demand not meeting peak production

## Energy Storage Locations
![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231031134959.png)

**Pumped hydro:** Large amounts of water are pumped to a large reservoir in a high location during low power demand periods using renewable or non renewable sources (depending on renewable effectiveness). When power demand peaks the water is released through a turbine into a lower reservoir, generating energy. 
Essentially the water acts as a large battery that is recharged in downtime.
