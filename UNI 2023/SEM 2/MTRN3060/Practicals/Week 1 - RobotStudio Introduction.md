**Q: Describe the jog join function. What does it do? How does it effect the End Effector (end of the robotic arm, in this case a robot flange) (EE) position?**
The jog joint function allows the user to manually control with the mouse the position of a given joint. When used on the EE, it is able to rotate the end effector as the current end effector is just a robotic flange.

**Q: Describe the jog linear function, and what it does. How does it affect the joint's position?**
The jog linear function allows us to control the position of the end effector in 4 linear directions, this moves the rest of the robot automatically in order to facilitate the linear motion. The angle of the end effector head does not change.

**Q: Describe the jog orient function, and what it does. How does it effect the joint's position?**
The jog orient function rotates whatever is attached to the end effector on 3 different axis relative to the ground. This function moves the joints positions in order to facilitate smooth rotational movement. Whatever is held should only rotate about one axis.
