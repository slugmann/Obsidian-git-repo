## Risk Analysis
Systematic and scientific method to predict and subsequently assist to prevent occurrence of accident in a system.
It can be applied in all stages of design

**Event Consequence:** Degree of damage or loss from a failure
**Safety:** Judgement of risk acceptability for the system, it is based on avoidance of risk
**Qualitative Risk Analysis:** Potential loss is qualitatively estimated using linguistic scales, Low, Medium, High. A risk matrix is formed to categorize the level of the risk in form of frequency/likelihood of losses versus potential magnitude (amount) of losses in qualitative scales
**Quantitative Risk Analysis:** The quantitative risk analysis attempt to estimate the risk in form of probability/frequency of a loss.

### Assessment
*Three important question*
1. What can go wrong? : identifies the set of undesirable (e.g., incident) scenarios. 
2. What is the likelihood that it will go wrong? -Determine the probability or chances or frequencies of these scenarios. 
3. What are the consequences if it does go wrong?-Estimates the magnitude of potential losses.

*Method*
1. Definition of System: Define th
