## Risk Analysis
Systematic and scientific method to predict and subsequently assist to prevent occurrence of accident in a system.
It can be applied in all stages of design

**Event Consequence:** Degree of damage or loss from a failure
**Safety:** Judgement of risk acceptability for the system, it is based on avoidance of risk
**Qualitative Risk Analysis:** Potential loss is qualitatively estimated using linguistic scales, Low, Medium, High. A risk matrix is formed to categorize the level of the risk in form of frequency/likelihood of losses versus potential magnitude (amount) of losses in qualitative scales
**Quantitative Risk Analysis:** The quantitative risk analysis attempt to estimate the risk in form of probability/frequency of a loss.

### Assessment
*Three important question*
1. What can go wrong? : identifies the set of undesirable (e.g., incident) scenarios. 
2. What is the likelihood that it will go wrong? -Determine the probability or chances or frequencies of these scenarios. 
3. What are the consequences if it does go wrong?-Estimates the magnitude of potential losses.

*Method*
1. **Definition of System:** Define the system boundaries and objectives. collect information for assessing failure consequences.
2. **Identification of Hazards**: Identifies the possible hazards of concern for the defined system. Example: Toxins, corrosives, smoke, hire, dropping or moving object, hazardous processes
3. **Identification of System barriers**:
	1. Physically surround and isolate the hazard (passive structures)
	2. Minimize exposure to the hazard (protective gear, shields)
	3. Mitigate the hazardous conditions (eg, cooling, sprinklers, emergency evacuation system
4. **Event consequence assessment**: This step involves using analytical modelling tool to assess the hazard potential and subsequently translate into the potential consequences.
5. **Estimation of frequency (or Probability)**: This step involve analytical modelling tool to assess the hazard potential and subsequently translate into the potential consequences (harm to people, assets, contamination)
6. **Risk assessment and evaluation**: Assess risk by combining results of previous event likelihood and consequence steps for each failure scenario and associated consequences.
	1. Define risk acceptance criteria
	2. Develop strategies to avoid hazards, failure of barriers
	3. Optimize at the system level

## Types of Risks
Can be categorized by cause of risk or nature of loss or both
1. **Health Risk Analysis** Determine potential diseases and losses of life affecting humans, animals, and plants
2. **Safety Risk Analysis** Estimate potential harms caused by accidents (climate conditions, earthquakes, brush fires)
3. **Security Risk Analysis** Estimate access and harm caused due to war, terrorism, riot, crime
4. **Financial Risk Analysis** Determine potential individual, institutional and societal monetary losses
5. **Environment Risk Analysis** Determine losses due to noise, contamination, and pollution

## Risk Management
A practice involving coordinated activities to prevent, control, and minimizes losses incurred due to a risk exposure, and minimise losses incurred. Weighing alternatives and selecting appropriate actions by taking into account risk values, economic, legal, political, and technological issues.

- **Uncertainty** in risk analysis can be attributed to ambiguity, approximations and inconsistency in defining the architecture, variables, parameters and performances.
- **Uncertainty modeling** include characterization of the uncertainties, weaknesses or inaccuracies in the available data.
- Improper uncertainty characterization may lead to greater likelihood of an adverse event occurring.
- Uncertainty modeling started with the employment of safety factors that is followed by probabilistic analysis.
- Uncertainty can be classified as:
	- Objective uncertainty: It included the physical and statistical variability.
	- Subjective uncertainty: It included lack of knowledge, inconsistency in knowledge.

## Qualitative Risk Assessment
**Risk Matrices:** It is a two-dimensional presentation of likelihood and consequences of risk estimation. Qualitative scales for both dimensions to characterize the risk by categorizing probabilities and consequences on the two axes of a matrix.

### HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) Study
- Hazards arise in a plant due to deviations from normal behavior.
- A comprehensive HAZOP analysis identifies the all possible hazards and operability problems, recommended changes and studies etc.

1. Discrete the PFDs and P&IDs into a number of small process units. 
2. Select a study node.
3. Illustrate the design intent of the study node. 
4. Choose a specific process parameter. 
5. Combines a guide word with process parameter to suggest possible deviations. 
6. Find the possible causes and note any protective systems for the deviation. 
7. Examine the probable consequences for the deviation (if any). 
8. Recommend the porbable action iteam (what? by whom? by when?) 
9. Record all information in to the HazOp report.
