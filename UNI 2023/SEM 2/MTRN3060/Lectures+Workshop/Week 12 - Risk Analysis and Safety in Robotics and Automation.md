## Risk Analysis
Systematic and scientific method to predict and subsequently assist to prevent occurrence of accident in a system.
It can be applied in all stages of design

**Event Consequence:** Degree of damage or loss from a failure
**Safety:** Judgement of risk acceptability for the system, it is based on avoidance of risk
**Qualitative Risk Analysis:** Potential loss is qualitatively estimated using linguistic scales, Low, Medium, High. A risk matrix is formed to categorize the level of the risk in form of frequency/likelihood of losses versus potential magnitude (amount) of losses in qualitative scales
**Quantitative Risk Analysis:** The quantitative risk analysis attempt to estimate the risk in form of probability/frequency of a loss.

### Assessment
*Three important question*
1. What can go wrong? : identifies the set of undesirable (e.g., incident) scenarios. 
2. What is the likelihood that it will go wrong? -Determine the probability or chances or frequencies of these scenarios. 
3. What are the consequences if it does go wrong?-Estimates the magnitude of potential losses.

*Method*
1. **Definition of System:** Define the system boundaries and objectives. collect information for assessing failure consequences.
2. **Identification of Hazards**: Identifies the possible hazards of concern for the defined system. Example: Toxins, corrosives, smoke, hire, dropping or moving object, hazardous processes
3. **Identification of System barriers**:
	1. Physically surround and isolate the hazard (passive structures)
	2. Minimize exposure to the hazard (protective gear, shields)
	3. Mitigate the hazardous conditions (eg, cooling, sprinklers, emergency evacuation system
4. **Event consequence assessment**: This step involves using analytical modelling tool to assess the hazard potential and subsequently translate into the potential consequences.
5. **Estimation of frequency (or Probability)**: This step involve analytical modelling tool to assess the hazard potential and subsequently translate into the potential consequences (harm to people, assets, contamination)
6. **Risk assessment and evaluation**: Assess risk by combining results of previous event likelihood and consequence steps for each failure scenario and associated consequences.
	1. Define risk acceptance criteria
	2. Develop strategies to avoid hazards, failure of barriers
	3. Optimize at the system level

## Types of Risks
Can be categorized by cause of risk or nature of loss or both
1. **Health Risk Analysis** Determine potential diseases and losses of life affecting humans, animals, and plants
2. **Safety Risk Analysis** Estimate potential harms caused by accidents (climate conditions, earthquakes, brush fires)
3. **Security Risk Analysis** Estimate access and harm caused due to war, terrorism, riot, crime
4. **Financial Risk Analysis** Determine potential individual, institutional and societal monetary losses
5. **Environment Risk Analysis** Determine losses due to noise, contamination, and pollution
