# Operators
The same forms for mapping points between frames can be interpreted as operators that translate points.
**Operators translate and rotate vectors on the same frame**

## Translation Operators
$$^{A}P_{2} = ^{A}P_{1} + ^{A}Q$$
Where Q is the translation vector

## Rotational Operators
$$^{A}P_{2} = R_{k}(\theta) ^{A}P_{1}$$
Using the rotation matrices from before


## Transformation Operators
$$^{A}P_{2} = T ^{A}P_{1}$$
T can rotate and translate at the same time



# Transform Arithmetic
$$^{A}P = ^{A}_{B}T ^{B}$$
