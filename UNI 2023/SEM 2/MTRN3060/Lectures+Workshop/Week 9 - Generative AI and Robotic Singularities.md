## Neural Network Topologies
### Perceptron (P) (Single Layer)
![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231119134312.png)
Used for classification. Has only input and output cells. Not capable of higher order tasks

### Feedforward (FF)

- Nodes do not ever form a cycle.
- All perceptrons are arranged in layers where the input layer takes input, the output layers give output. Other than input the hidden cells have no connection to the outer world.
