## Important of Industrial Automation
1. **Improved Efficiency:** Can run 24/7, Can perform repetitive tasks with precision and consistency
2. **Enhanced Quality Control:** High accuracy and repeatability, consistent product quality, reduction in defects
3. **Increased Productivity:** Can work faster than humans, produce more with same or fewer resources
4. **Cost Reduction:** Initial investment is high, long term savings, reduced labour cost, minimise waste, decrease energy consumption. Avoid error related costs
5. **Safety Improvement:** Can handle dangerous, repetitive, or demanding tasks reducing the ris off workplace injuries. Safety measures can be implemented for cobots.
6. **Flexibility and Scalability:** Flexible and easily adaptable to changes in production requirements, can accommodate new product designs with minimal reprogramming/tooling
7. **Data Collection and Analysis** Data collection during production. Data can be analyzed to optimise and predict maintenance needs.
8. **conservation of Resources:** Conserve valuable resources, reduces waste and recycles.
9. **Quality of Work Life:** Automation frees humans from mundane tasks.
10. **Adaptation to Technological Advances:** Can be easily upgraded or integrated with new tech, ensuring that a company's processes remain up to date.

## Components of Industrial Automation Systems
-  Controllers (PLC, DCS)
- Field industrial devices (sensors)
- Industrial communication and networking
- Human machine interface (HMI)
- Supervisory control and data acquisition software (SCADA)
- Personal computers (PC)
