## Important of Industrial Automation
1. **Improved Efficiency:** Can run 24/7, Can perform repetitive tasks with precision and consistency
2. **Enhanced Quality Control:** High accuracy and repeatability, consistent product quality, reduction in defects
3. **Increased Productivity:** Can work faster than humans, produce more with same or fewer resources
4. **Cost Reduction:** Initial investment is high, long term savings, reduced labour cost, minimise waste, decrease energy consumption. Avoid error related costs
5. **Safety Improvement:** Can handle dangerous, repetitive, or demanding tasks reducing the ris off workplace injuries. Safety measures can be implemented for cobots.
6. **Flexibility and Scalability:** Flexible and easily adaptable to changes in production requirements, can accommodate new product designs with minimal reprogramming/tooling
7. **Data Collection and Analysis** Data collection during production. Data can be analyzed to optimise and predict maintenance needs.
8. **conservation of Resources:** Conserve valuable resources, reduces waste and recycles.
9. **Quality of Work Life:** Automation frees humans from mundane tasks.
10. **Adaptation to Technological Advances:** Can be easily upgraded or integrated with new tech, ensuring that a company's processes remain up to date.

## Components of Industrial Automation Systems
-  Controllers (PLC, DCS)
- Field industrial devices (sensors)
- Industrial communication and networking
- Human machine interface (HMI)
- Supervisory control and data acquisition software (SCADA)
- Personal computers (PC)

## Levels of Industrial Automation

**Field**
Closest to physical processes being controlled. Includes sensors, actuators, motor drives, switches, and instruments. Can perform simple tasks, and sometimes sensor info is not sent and just used for automation.

**Control and Communication**
Data collected from field level is processed and used to control various processes. It includes programmable logic controllers (PLCs), distributed control systems (DCS), and other automation controllers. Controllers make decisions based on data from field and send commands to devices at the field level.

**Management (Enterprise)**
Highest level, uses supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA systems, manufacturing execution systems (MES) and other software applications to provide a broader view of the entire industrial operation. Data collected from control level is aggregated and analysed at this level to make strategic decisions, monitor performance and optimise.

## SCADA
SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition. It is a type of software and hardware system used for monitoring and controlling industrial processes and infrastructure in real-time. SCADA systems are commonly used in industries such as manufacturing, energy, water treatment, transportation, and more. key features and components of SCADA software include:
- **Data Acquisition:** SCADA software collects data from various sensors, instruments, and devices located in the field.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** SCADA systems provide real-time monitoring of industrial processes.
- **Control:** In addition to monitoring, SCADA systems can also control industrial processes
- **Alarming:** SCADA software includes alarm management features.
