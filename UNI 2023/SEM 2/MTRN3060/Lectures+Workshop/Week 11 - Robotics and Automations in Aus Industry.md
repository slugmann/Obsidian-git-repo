## Machine Safety and Safety Components

**Safety Fencing**
Safety fencing is used to separate human workspaces from robots or heavy machinery, these can have sensors and limit switches to detect a human entering the space and can stop production.

**Light Curtain**
Light curtain use beam brakes (usually IR) to determine proximity to the machine. If the light curtain is broken then the robot knows the human in interacting with the system. The system can slow, or stop in these cases.

**Safety Scanner**
Can scan the area to determine objects in the way. Can be used in automation or in robotics
