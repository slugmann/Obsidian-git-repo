# Distilled Info

## Sensors
- Temp sensors
- Proximity sensors
	- Can detect presence of an object without physical contact
		- Inductive
		- Capacitive
		- Magnetic
		- Ultrasonic
		- Photoelectric
- Level measurements
- Flow sensors

### Operating Principles and Parameters
- Material

- Package
![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231118195031.png)
We can have digital or analog depending on the sensor used and the application
### Inductive
Can detect proximity of purely metallic object. Measures changes in magnetic field produced. A magnetic field is generated by the sensor, eddy currents are induced in metallic objects. These eddy currents result in an "inductance" reducing the energy of the field and changing the angle.
**Ferrous Metals:**
- Iron
- Steel

**Non-Ferrous Metals**
- Copper
- Aluminium
- Brass

### Capacitive Proximity Sensors
Detect the object through the change in sensor's capacitance
**Capacitive sensors use an electrostatic field**

Can detect any object.
