# Distilled Info

## Sensors
- Temp sensors
- Proximity sensors
	- Can detect presence of an object without physical contact
		- Inductive
		- Capacitive
		- Magnetic
		- Ultrasonic
		- Photoelectric
- Level measurements
- Flow sensors

### Operating Principles and Parameters
- Material
- Shape
- Dimension
- Colour
- Speed
- Package

### Inductive
Can detect proximity of purely metallic object.
**Ferrous Metals:**
- Iron
- Steel

**Non-Ferrous Metals**
- Copper
- Aluminium
- Brass

### Capacitive Proximity Sensors
Detect the object through the change in sensor's capacitance
**Capacitive sensors use an electrostatic field**

Can detect any object.

## Definition of Controller
Once a robot has a motion plan, its time to act. How do you ensure, that the robot's execution follows the desired plan? Controlling a large robotic system to do a task often involves solving
