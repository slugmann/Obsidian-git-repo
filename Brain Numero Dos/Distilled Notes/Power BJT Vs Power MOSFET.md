# BJT
- Cutoff and saturation is used for power switching
- High power rated BJTs have an **additional N channel**
- Current Controlled Device
- **Medium** switching speed
- Usually Used in common emitter config
- Generally superseded by other tech, although cheaper than MOSFETs
- Used in output of audio amps, touch sensitive switches, computer controlled relays, and **LOW POWER** AC and DC Supplies

| Parameter       | Measure                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Switching Speed | 10s of kHz                      |
| Amperage        | some can handle 10-100s of amps |
| Voltage         | Up to 1kV                       |


# MOSFETs
- Most common Power Semiconductor
- **High switching speed**
- Good low voltage efficiency
- Often low gain
- Commonly used for **relatively low voltage switching (<200V)**
- Vertical structure means voltage depends on doping and thickness of N+ layers
- Current depends on channel width

|         |                   |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| voltage | Up to around 200V |
| Freq    | excess of 100kHz  |

Used for high power rapid switching
