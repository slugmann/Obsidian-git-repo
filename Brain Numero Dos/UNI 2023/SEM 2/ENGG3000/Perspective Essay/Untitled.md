**EE4 Embedded Systems and Edge Computing**: With the proliferation of IoT, there's a growing need for processing data at the source, leading to advances in embedded systems and edge computing.

**Infrastructure Needs**: Many regions need better roads, schools, hospitals, and public transportation.


1. **Abstract/Executive summary**  
• An executive summary of your perspective based on background research into the topic.  
2. **Introduction/background**  
• All the relevant background information for the perspective piece. Research work etc.  
• Include an opening line on your perspective, i.e. the thesis of the work.  
3. **Body/Discussion**  
• List and discuss the topics. Each paragraph's section should support the thesis  
statement.  
• There should be a logical flow between arguments.  
• There could be counterarguments or alternative views.  
4. **Conclusion/impact**  
• Summaries the arguments provided in the body paragraphs that support the thesis.  
• State the impact and implementation of the thesis and possible future consideration.  
5. **Reference list**  
• This isn't a bibliography; references should be integrated directly into the text with in-  
text citations. The complete list of references should be provided in this section using  
the IEEE citation style. Prioritise references from post-2021, focusing on recognized  
journal papers and review articles rather than web pages.
