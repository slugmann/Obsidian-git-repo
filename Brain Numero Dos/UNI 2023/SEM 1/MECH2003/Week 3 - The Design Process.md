The process in which scientific principles and the tools of engineering - mathematics, computers, graphics and language are used to produce a plan, which when carried out, will satisfy a human need

# The Design Process
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230327143923.png]]

1. **Identification of Need**: What needs to be solved? Also known as identification of need. Recognising what the problem *may be* and phrasing it in a way that can be communicated to others. Projects may have conflicting requirements, stakeholders are often ignorant of, it's our job to fix 'em.

3. **Definition of the problem**: Defining the problem is a critical task and cannot be understated. It is required to be detailed and include specifications that the solution must comply to in order to be successful. Should also consider the input and output of a given system. Anything that limits freedom of choice may be considered a *constraint* and should be outlined thoroughly. These can includes manufacturing, legal, regulatory, material, time, and financial constraints. Aim should be measurable and an include a date to be achieved by.

It may be necessary to return to step 1 (identification of need) discuss with stakeholders and re-evaluate
```


3. **Synthesis**: The Synthesis is a proposed strategy/plan that will be considered to solve the identified problem. This step involves identifying possible ways of solving the definition of the problem. All suggestions should be documented, and some analysis should be conducted to either promote or discount a suggestion based on merit. All assumptions about the system (temporary values) must be clearly stated. It is necessary to synthesise, optimise, and repeat, it may take several iterations

4. **Analysis and Optimisation**: Requires mathematical models be created and utilised to assist with predicting system performance. These must be relative to the aims outlined as part of the definition to the problem.  *This also includes cost analysis and comparisons to competing designs both in the marketplace and other synthesised plans*. Risk must also be included (community, environment, operator, etc)

In the event analysis demonstrates the need is not met or the plan is otherwise non-viable. Repeat step 3 (Synthesis) and determine an alternate plan/design. This is normal, and should happen multiple times before presentation. You may even need to re-identify the need if analysis proves it is not feasible to address those specific aims.

5. **Evaluation**: Physical testing is conducted to validate the mathematical models created in step 4 (Analysis and Optimisation) This is done using prototypes. All results must be carefully measured and compared with the aims determined at the beginning.
```ad-important

From this step, it may be necessary to revisit any of the other previous steps if evaluation of the prototypes yields unfavourable results. Mathematical models may need to be revisited. It is critical that each iteration of the design cycle is documented, to prevent unnecessary repetition.
```

6. **Presentation**: Once the need has been satisfied, the design needs to be presented to stakeholders or potential customers. Presentation is still just as critical as each of the other steps, arguably more. If the design is not widely recognised as solving the need that has been addresses, then there is little value in having addressed the need.
