# Why is small volume manufacturing important?
Particularly in research and development. There is a need to be able to manufacture bespoke pieces of equipment in a cost-effective manner. Examples include.
- Prototyping
- Product research and development
- Custom machinery

## What kind of components do we use?
- Bearings (linear and rotary)
	Minimise the friction between components (linear rails and rotating shafts)
- Pulleys, belts, chain drives, and gears
	Coupling methods for transferring torque from one shaft to another or to another location.
- Flexible couplings CV Joints
	Direct method for coupling two shafts that are close to being aligned. They attach between two non-aligned shafts and transmit power through a flexible center.
- Fasteners
	Allows components to be non-permamently or permanently joined together. (Bolts, screws, clamps, etc)
- Motors
	Electric Motors allow mechanical power to be generated wherever there is suitable electrical supply. IC Engines (Internal Combustion) Use fuel to generate torque
- Piping and Ducting Sections
	Used to transport gas and fluids in a mechanical system.
- Extrusions, billets, plate and sheet metal
	Raw materials, metal and other materials are available as either extrusions, billets, or sheets. Some extrusions are designed specifically for assembly (rails). A lot more machining is required when working with billets, so it's preferred to use initial materials most similar to your final component.
	Sheet metal can be folded from a net (2D foldable design) to create shapes so long as the part doesn't need significant wall thickness.

# Manufacturing Techniques

## Material Removal Techniques
[[Week 6 - Material Removal Methods]]
*Starting with a piece of greater desired component geometry is achieved.*
- CNC Machining
- Milling
	![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230424113718.png]]
- Cutting
- Grinding
- Chiselling
- Lathe

## Additive Material Techniques
*Laying material such that the final components volume is similar to the volume of material used.*
- 3D Printing
- Casting
- Rapid Prototyping

# Material Removal Theory
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20230424113812.png]]
This is controlled by the speed (or RPM) of the spindle. The following equation can assist with determining the correct RPM after selecting the appropriate cutting speed from the table.
$$RPM = \frac{300 * \text{Cutting Speed}}{\text{Diameter}}$$

```ad-note
It's also important to account for heat buildup in both the part and the drill bits. An ideal cutting speed ensures the heat is concentrated on the chips being removed. Lubricant and coolant is used for this reason.

# Summary
1. There are many available components that can be purchased pre-processesd to create mechanical systems.
2. When the desired components can not be purchased, small volume manufacturing techniques can be used to achieve the desired result.
3. The manufacturing process will usually rely on adding or removing material to achieve the desired component (Forging is also an option but we wont look at it here)
