**Draw an ER for the case study below.**

Sheldon and Stuart have decided to co-operate. They have established an organisation that will run tournaments for video games across various branches of the comic book store. Sheldon was supposed to design the database but has unfortunately been called in for emergency work on the infinite persistence gyroscope. He has decided to outsource the work to you instead. The business rules are as follows: 

- A branch is uniquely identified. It will need to store its address, contact number and website.  
    

- Video games need to store their name, current patch version and the console they are played on.  
    

- Competitors need to register with the organisation to compete at tournaments. New competitors need to submit their name, dob, username and email address. They are assigned a unique number.  
    

- Tournaments are held for a specific video game. They will be at a branch and multiple competitors will compete. If a player is sponsored to compete in a tournament, their sponsors name is recorded. Every time a tournament is run, the prize money is recorded.
