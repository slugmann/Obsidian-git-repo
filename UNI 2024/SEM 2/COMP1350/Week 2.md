# Business Rules
- Statements that define or constrain aspects of business.
	- Derived from policies, procedures, events and functions within the organisation.
	- They assert structure and control / influence behaviour, ensuring consistency and adherence to **organisational standards**.
	- Expressed in terms familiar to end users
- Using a [[Database Management System]] (DMS) software, Business Rules can be automated
	- Ensures data quality
- Critical to maintaining data quality, enforcing policies, streamlining business processes.
- Usually used to inform the structure of a businesses database
## Characteristics of Business Rules
 - **Description**: Business rules describe policies procedures or principles within a specific organisation. Defines what actions are acceptable or not
- **Applicability**: Rules apply to any organisation that stores and uses data to generate information.
- **Example**: A business rule could be: "A pilot should not fly more than 14 hours a day". which describes an operation to create and enforce an action within an organization's environment.
- **Documentation**: Business rules must be in writing and kept up to date.


They should have the following characteristics:

1. **Declarative**: It focuses on *what* needs to be done rather than *how*.
2. **Precise**: The rule is clear and has an agreed upon meaning.
3. **Atomic**: The rule should be a single standalone statement that addresses a specific aspect of business.
4. **Consistent**: The rule is internally consistent within itself and does not conflict with other rules or policies
5. **Expressible**: Can be easily understood and expressed in natural language.
6. **Distinct**: Non-redundant, avoiding duplication or overlap with other rules.
7. **Business oriented**: Written in a manner that can be easily understood by businesspeople and stakeholders.

title: Conceptual Data Modelling
- Initial phase of database design process
- Create a high level and abstract representation of the database.

- Often represented using an [[Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)]] or an [[Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram (EERD)]]
