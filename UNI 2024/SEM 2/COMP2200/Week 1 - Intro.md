# Intro

## Data Science - Hype Cycle
> [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle) provide a graphic representation of the maturity and adoption of technologies and applications, and how they are potentially relevant to solving real business problems and exploiting new opportunities.
> 
> Gartner Hype Cycle methodology gives you a view of how a technology or application will evolve over time, providing a sound source of insight to manage its deployment within the context of your specific business goals.

Each Hype Cycle drills down into the five key lifecycle phases
- Innovation Trigger
	- Potential tech breakthrough 
	- **early proof of concept stories** and media interest
	- Often no useable product, commercial viability is unproven.
- Peak of Inflated Expectations
	- Early publicity produces success stories - often **accompanied by scores of failures**
	- **Some** company action and adoption
- Trough of Disillusionment
	- Interest wanes as **implementations fail to deliver**
	- Producers fail or move on
	- Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products
- Slope of Enlightenment
	- More applications of the tech are found and are adopted
	- Second and third gen products appear
	- More pilots funded
	- Conservative companies remain cautious
- Plateau of Productivity
	- Mainstream adoption takes off
	- Better criteria for understanding provider viability
	- Market applicability and relevance pay off
