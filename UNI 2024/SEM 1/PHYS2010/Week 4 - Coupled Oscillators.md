## Pendula coupled by spring
For small angles, pendulum motion is *almost horizontal*...

$$x = l\sin \theta \approx l \theta$$
$$h = x\tan \theta \approx l \theta^2$$

With restoring force $-\left( \frac{mg}{l} \right)x$
$$\ddot{x} + \left( \frac{g}{l} \right)x = 0$$


**Define horizontal displacements y and x**
**Extension of spring is x-y**
$$F_{s} = k(x-y)$$


Calculate forces given displacement
Find equation for motion for each pendulum **Coupled Equations**
$$m \ddot{x} = -\left( \frac{mg}{l} \right)x - k(x-y) \text{ Eq. A}$$
$$m \ddot{y} = -\left( \frac{mg}{l} \right)y + k(x-y) \text{ Eq. B}$$

*Spring extension is (x-y), gives positive force on y mass and negative on x mass*

### Decoupling the equations
$$(A) + (B): m(\ddot{x}+\ddot{y})=-\left( \frac{mg}{l} \right) (x+y)$$
$$\ddot{X} = -\left( \frac{g}{l} \right)X \text{ Where: } X = x+y$$
$$(A)-(B): m(\ddot{x}-\ddot{y})= - \left( \frac{mg}{l} \right)(x-y)-2k(x)$$


# Conceptual Info
---

Multiple oscillators, 'coupled' in some way so they may exchange energy.
We need to identify **normal modes:**
- Simple vibration patterns.
- General solution is a superposition of normal modes.

- Consider two pendula coupled by a spring
	- Define placement for each pendulum
	- Calculate forces given displacement
	- Find equation of motion for each pendulum
- New element: Spring force depends on both displacements
	- Motion of each pendulum depends on the other
	- Equation of motion depends on the position of both
- For small angles, we can neglect the vertical component of the motion (cringe)
