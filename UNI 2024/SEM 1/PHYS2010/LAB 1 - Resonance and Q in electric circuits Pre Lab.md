1. **Explain in one sentence each the meaning of capacitor and inductor**
	A capacitor is a device used to store electric energy in an electric field, usually comprised of two plates separated by a dielectric compound. An inductor is a device that stores energy in a magnetic field when a current flows through it, usually comprised of a coil of wire.
2. Find the resonant angular frequency 𝜔଴ and the period 𝑇 for an RLC circuit with 𝑅 = 100 Ω, 𝐶 = 0.1 F, and 𝐿 = 0.5 H. (That’s a pretty large capacitance by the way).
