1. **Explain in one sentence each the meaning of capacitor and inductor**
	A capacitor is a device used to store electric energy in an electric field, usually comprised of two plates separated by a dielectric compound. An inductor is a device that stores energy in a magnetic field when a current flows through it, usually comprised of a coil of wire.
2. Find the resonant angular frequency 𝜔଴ and the period 𝑇 for an RLC circuit with 𝑅 = 100 Ω, 𝐶 = 0.1 F, and 𝐿 = 0.5 H. (That’s a pretty large capacitance by the way).
$$\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ LC }}$$

$\omega_{0} = 4.47 \frac{rad}{s}$
$T = 1.40$

3. How would your answer for the angular frequency 𝜔଴ in Q2 change if you doubled the resistance 𝑅? Would anything else change?
Doubling the resistance would not change angular frequency. It will halve the Q factor, and reduce the maximum current.

4. Suppose you connected a DMM set to ammeter mode in the circuit with the parameters in Q2. Describe what you would observe.
You would observe the current oscillating at the resonant frequency 4.47 rad/s, amplitude Imax, and period 1.40.
