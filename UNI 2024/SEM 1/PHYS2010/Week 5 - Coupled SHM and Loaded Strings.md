## Review: Properties of Normal Modes

For a **normal mode**:
- Oscillation is independent of other normal modes coordinates
- Energy is not transferred to other normal modes
- All oscillators have a fixed phase relation
- All oscillators have fixed amplitude ratio
- All oscillators share the same frequency

- N oscillators $\rightarrow$ N normal modes
- Lowest frequency mode has all oscillators in phase
- Highest frequency mode has adjacent oscillators out of phase
