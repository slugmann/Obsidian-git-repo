## Waves, Diffraction and Interference

**Wave equation**
$$\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial t^{2}} = c^{2} \nabla u$$


**Schrodinger's Equation**
$$i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi (r,t) = \left[  -\frac{\hbar^{2}{2 \mu}}+V(r,t_{}) \right] \Psi (r,t)$$

## Mass on a spring, basic oscillation

**Hooke's Law**
$$F = -kd$$
- d is extension **from relaxed length**
- Linear restoring force characterized by **stiffness k**

Consider a system at any non-equilibrium position $x$
Since $F=ma$
- $-kx = ma = m\ddot{x}$
- $\ddot{x} = -\left( \frac{k}{m} \right)x$
