# Response Characteristics and System Configurations

## Response Characteristics

## Two major configurations
- **open loop** - does not correct for disturbances and is commanded by the input. (eg, toaster)

- **closed loop** - compensates for disturbances by measuring the output response, feeding that measurement back through a feedback path, and comparing that response to the input at the summing junction.

# Analysis and design objectives
- a **Control system** responds to an input by undergoing a *transient response* before reaching a ***steady state response***.
