# Frequency Response (Bode Plots)
- Not as intuitive as root locus
- Provides a new vantage point from which to view feedback control systems:
	- When modelling TF functions from physical data.
	- Designing lead compensators to meet a steady-state error requirement and a transient response requirement
	- Finding the stability of nonlinear systems
	- In settling ambiguities when sketching root locus

- In the steady state, sinusoidal inputs to a linear system generate sinusoidal responses of the same frequency.
- Responses are of the same frequency as the input, they differ in magnitude and phase angle from the input.
- These differences are functions of frequency
- **Sinusoids representation**
	- Sinusoids can be represented as complex numbers called *phasors*
	- A system
