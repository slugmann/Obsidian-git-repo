## Categorization

$$c(t) = c_{\text{forced}}(t) + c_{\text{natural}}(t)$$

A system is **stable** if the natural response approaches zero as time approaches infinity
*Stable systems have closed-loop transfer functions with poles only in **left hand plane (negative real part)***

A system is **unstable** if the natural response approaches infinity as time approaches infinity
*Unstable systems have closed loop transfer functions with at least one pole in the right half-plane (positive real part)*

A system is **marginally stable** if the natural response neither decays nor grows but remains constant or oscillates
