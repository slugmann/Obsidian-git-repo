# Time Response

## Time Response
- How to find the time response from the transfer function
- How to use poles and zeros to determine the response of a control system
- How to describe quantitatively the transient response of first and second order systems
- How to approximate higher-order systems as first or second order
- How to find the time response from the state-space representation

### Poles and zeros of a First-Order System
```ad-note
**Poles** of a transfer function are the values of the Laplace transform variable, $s$, that cause the transfer function to become infinite.

**Zeros** of a transfer funtion are the values of the Laplace transform variable, $s$, that cause the transfer function to become zero.
