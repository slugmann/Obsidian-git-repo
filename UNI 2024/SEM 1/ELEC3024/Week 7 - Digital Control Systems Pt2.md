# Stability
- The difference between analogue feedback control systems and digital feedback control systems is the **effect that the sampling rate has on the transient response.**
- **Changes in sampling rate** not only change the nature of the response from overdamped to underdamped, but also can turn a stable system into an unstable one.
- Stability of digital systems from two perspectives:
	- z-plane
	- s-plane
- **Routh-Hurwitz criterion** can be used only if we perform our analysis and the design on the s-plane


Each region of the s-plane can be mapped into a corresponding region on the z-plane
- If $\alpha$ positive $\rightarrow e^{\alpha T}>1 \rightarrow$ points outside unit circle (C)
- If $\alpha$ zero $\rightarrow e^{\alpha T}=1 \rightarrow$ points on unit circle (B)
- if $\alpha$ is negative $\rightarrow e^{\alpha T}<1 \rightarrow$ points inside unit circle (A)
$$z = e^{Ts} = e^{T(\alpha+j \omega)}= e^{\alpha T}e^{j \omega T}$$
$$=e^{\alpha T} (\cos \omega T + j \sin \omega T)$$
$$=e^{\alpha T}\angle \omega T$$

## Digital System via the z-Plane
- Digital control system is 
	- **Stable if all poles of the closed-loop transfer function, T(z) are inside the unit circle on the z-plane**
	- *Unstable if any pole is outside the unit circle* and/or there are poles of multiplicity greater than one on the unit circle.
	- **Marginally stable** if poles of **multiplicity 1 are on the unit circle** and *all other poles are inside the unit circle*.

## Review
- $j \omega$-axis in the s-plane is mapped to the unit circle in the z-plane
- The left-hand s-plane is mapped to the inside of the unit circle
- The right-hand s-plane maps to the outside of the unit circle

## Intro
- For continuous systems, we can find the stability of a system by determining if the **roots of the denominator of the CL TF function are in the stable region** of the s-plane.
- The **problem for high-order systems** is that CL TF denominator is in **polynomial form, not factored form**.
- The same problem occurs with closed-loop **sampled-data transfer functions.**
- **Tabular methods for determining stability** such as the Routh-Hurwitz method used for higher-order continuous systems, exist for sampled-data systems.
	- Raible's tabular method
	- Jury's stability test

## Example - Range of T for stability
**Problem:** Determine the range of sampling interval, T, that will make the system shown in fig(13.15) below, and the range that will make it unstable.
**Solution:** Since H(s) = 1, the z-transform of the closed-loop system T(z) is found from fig(13.10) to be:

Eq (1)$$T(z) = \frac{G(z)}{1+G(z)}$$![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240428171243.png)
To find G(z) first find the particial-fraction expansion of G(s)
Eq (2)$$G(s) = 10 \frac{1-e^{-Ts}}{s(s+1)}= 10 (1-e^{-Ts})\left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+1} \right)$$

Taking the z-transform, we obtain
Eq (3)$$G(z) = \frac{10 (z-1)}{z}\left[ \frac{z}{z-1} - \frac{z}{z-e^{-T}} \right] = 10 \frac{1-e^{-T}}{z-e^{-T}}$$
Subbing Eq (3) into Eq (1) yields Eq(4):
$$T(z) = \frac{10(1-e^{-T})}{z-(11e^{-T}-10)}$$

The pole of the above equation, $(11e^{-T}-10)$ monotonically decreases from +1 to -1 for 0<T<0.2.

For 0.2<T<$\infty$, $(11e^{-T}-10)$ monotonically decreases from -1 to -10. Thus the pole of T(z) will be inside the unit circle, and the system will be stable if 0<T<0.2. In terms of frequency, where f = 1/T, the system will be stable as long as the sampling frequency is 1/0.2, 5Hz or greater.

## Bilinear Transformation
- Bilinear transformations allow us to apply the s-plane analysis and design techniques to digital systems.
- We **prefer a simple transformation** that would yield linear arguments when transforming in both directions (bilinear) through direct substitution and **without complicated z transform**
- Bilinear transformations have been derived to **yield linear variables in s and z**

Of the form: $z = \frac{as+b}{cs+d}$

and its inverse: $s = \frac{-dz + b}{cz-a}$

- Different values of a,b,c and d have been derived for particular applications and **yield various degrees of accuracy** when comparing properties of the continuous and sampled functions.
- Since the **transformations are not exact,** only the property for which they are designed can be relied upon.
- For the stability transformation, **we cannot expect the resulting G(s) to have the same transient response as G(z).**

## Digital system stability via the s-plane
The bilinear transformation:
$$s = \frac{z+1}{z-1}$$

and its inverse:
$$z = \frac{s+1}{s-1}$$
Perform the required transformation

### Example - Stability via Ruth-Hurwitz
**Problem:** Given $T(z) = \frac{N(z)}{D(z)}$ where $D(z) = z^{3} - z^{2} - 0.2z + 0.1$, use the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to find the number of z-plane poles of T(z) inside, outside and on the unit circle. Is the system stable?

**Solution:** Sub Eq(4) into D(z) = 0 and obtain:
$$s^{3} - 19s^{2}-45s - 17 = 0$$

The Routh table for the above equation shows one root in the right half plane and two roots in the left half plane. Hence T(z) has one pole outside the unit circle, no poles on the unit circle, and two poles inside the circle. The system is unstable because of the pole outside the unit circle.

# Steady-state errors
- For continuous time systems, there was only one open-loop transfer function.
- For discrete time (digital) systems, **the placement of the sampler changes the open loop transfer function**

Consider the digital feedback control system in Fig(a)
![800](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240428175904.png)

- The digital system is represented by the sampler and ZOH
- $G_{1}(s)$ is the transfer function of the plant
- $\frac{1-e^{-Ts}}{s}$ is the transfer function of ZOH
- $G(s)$ is the product of ZOH and G1(s) in fig(b)
- We use block diagram reduction techniques to find sampled error $E^{*}(s) = E(z)$
- Adding synchronous samplers at the input and at the feedback we obtain fig(b)
- Pushing G(s) and its input sampler to the right past the pickoff point yields fig(c)
- Using block diagram reduction, we can convert each to its z-transform resulting in fig(d)

From fig(d) we calculate $E(z) = R(z) - E(z) G(z)$ or:
$$E(z) = \frac{R(z)}{1+G(z)}$$
![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240428181743.png)
- The final value theorem for discrete signals states that:
$$e^{*}(\infty) = \lim_{  z\to 1 } (1-z^{-1})E(z)$$
Where $e^{*}(\infty)$ is the final sampled value of e(t) or the final value of e(kT).

Applying the final value theorem on E(z), we find that the sampled steady state error $e^{*}(\infty)$ for unity negative-feedback system.
$$e^{*}(\infty) = \lim_{ z \to 1 }(1-z^{-1})E(z) = \lim_{ z \to 1 } (1-z^{-1}) \frac{R(z)}{1+G(z)}$$
We must now evaluate this for each input

![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240428182407.png)
**Step:**
$$e^{*}(\infty) = \frac{1}{1+K_{p}}$$
$$K_{p} = \lim_{ z \to 1 }G(z) $$

**Ramp:**
$$e^{*}(\infty) = \frac{1}{K_{v}}$$
$$K_{v} = \frac{1}{T} \lim_{ z \to 1 } (z-1)G(z)$$

**Parabola**
$$e^{*}(\infty) = \frac{1}{K_{a}}$$
$$K_{a} = \frac{1}{T^{2}} \lim_{ z \to 1 } (z-1)^{2}G(z)$$

## Summary
- The equations developed previously for $e^{*}(\infty)$, $K_{p}$ and $K_{v}$ and $K_{a}$ are similar to the equations developed for the analogue systems.
- We know that multiple pole placement at the origin of the s-plane reduced steady-state errors to 0
- We see that multiple pole placement at z=1 reduces the steady state error to zero for digital systems of the type discussed previously.
	- For **step input** if G(z) has **one pole at z=1** the *steady state error will reduce to zero.*
	- For **ramp input** if G(z) has **two poles at z=1** the *steady state error will reduce to zero.*
	- For **parabolic input** if G(z) has **two poles at z=1** the *steady state error will reduce to zero.*

# Transient response on the z-plane
- Continuous-time systems a transient response requirement was specified by selecting a closed-loop s-plane pole.
- If the closed-loop **pole was on the existing root locus**
	- Then the design consisted of a simple gain adjustement
- If the closed-loop pole was not on the existing root locus
	- Then a **cascade compensator** was designed to reshape the original root locus to go through the desired closed-loop pole.
	- A gain adjustment then completed the design.
- Let's parallel the described continuous-time methods and apply similar techniques to discrete-time systems.

- We know now that in the s-plane 
	- **Vertical lines** were lines of **constant settling time**
	- **Horizontal lines** were lines of **constant peak time** 
	- **Radial lines** were lines of **constant percent overshoot**
- In order to draw equivalent conclusions on the z-plane, we now map those lines through $z = e^{sT}$

## Lines on the Z plane
- For *vertical lines* on the s-plane, consider $s = \sigma_{1}+j \omega$
	- Where $\sigma_{1} = -4 /T_{s}$ is constant and is in the left hand plane for stability
- Subbing this into $z = e^{sT}$ we obtain $z = e^{\sigma_{1}T}e^{j \omega T} = r_{1}e^{j \omega T}$
	- Equation above represents **concentric circles** of radius $r_{1}$
	- The circles of constant settling time ($T_{s}$) normalised to sampling interval (T) are shown in the figure, where $T_{s} = -\frac{4}{\ln r}$

- For *horizontal lines* on the s-plane: let's consider $s = \sigma + j \omega_{1}$
	- Where $\omega_{1} = \pi /T_{p}$ is constant
- Substituting this into $z = e^{sT}$ we obtain $z = e^{\sigma T} e^{j \omega_{1}T} = e^{\sigma T}e^{j \theta_{1}}$
	- Equation above represents **radial lines** of an angle $\theta_{1}$
	- the lines of constant peak time normalised to sampling interval (T) are shown in the fig. Where $\theta_{1} = \omega_{1}T = \pi / \left( \frac{T_{p}}{T} \right)\rightarrow \frac{T_{p}}{T} = \pi / \theta_{1}$ 

- *Radial lines* on the s-plane
	- These radial lines are represented by
	- $\frac{\sigma}{\omega} = -\tan(\sin^{-1}\zeta)= -\frac{\zeta}{\sqrt{ 1-\zeta^2 }}$
- Transforming the above to the z-plane yields:
	- $z = e^{sT} = e^{-\omega T(\zeta / \sqrt{ 1-\zeta^2 })}e^{j \omega T}=e^{-\omega T(\zeta / \sqrt{ 1-\zeta^{2} })}\angle \omega T$

# Cascade compensation via the s-plane
- We can make use of previous knowledge by designing on the s-plane then transforming our s-plane design to a digital implementation.
- Direct design of compensators on the z-plane is left for a dedicated course in digital control systems.

- We need a bilinear transformation that will preserve, at the sampling instants, the response of the continuous compensator.
- The bilinear transformation covered previously will not meet that requirement.
- A **bilinear transformation** that can be **performed with hand calculations** and yields a digital transfer function whose output response at the sampling instants is approximately the same as the equivalent analogue transfer function called the **Tustin transformation**.
- The Tustin transformation and its inverse are given below:
$$s = \frac{2(z-1)}{T(z+1)}$$
$$z = \frac{-\left( s+\frac{2}{T} \right)}{\left( s-\frac{2}{T} \right)} = \frac{1+ \frac{T}{2}s}{1- \frac{T}{2}s}$$![700](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240428193900.png)

- As the sampling interval, T, gets smaller (higher sampling rate), the designed digital compensator's output **yields a closer match to the analogue **
