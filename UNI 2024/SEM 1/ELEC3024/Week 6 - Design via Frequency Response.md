[Design via Frequency Response](Attachments/Workshop%20Ch11%20-%20Design%20via%20Frequency%20Response_annotated.pdf)

**Review of root locus design:**
- The transient response of a control system can be designed by adjusting the gain along the root locus
	- Finding the transient specification on the root locus
	- Setting the gain accordingly
	- Settling for the resulting steady-state error
- Disadvantage
	- Only the transient response and steady-state error represented by **points along the root locus** are available
- **Cascade compensators** have been introduced to meet transient response specifications represented by **points not on the locus** and, independently, steady-state
