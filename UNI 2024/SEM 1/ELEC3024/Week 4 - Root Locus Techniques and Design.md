# Root Locus
- A graphical technique that gives qualitative **description** of a control system's performance.
- Provide solutions for systems of order greater than two
- Describe qualitatively the performance (transient response) of a system as various parameters are changed
- Graphical representing a system's stability

## Vector Representation of Complex Numbers (1)

![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240314194050.png)$(s+a)$ is a complex number and can be represented by a vector drawn from the zero of the function to the point s

The goal here is to keep the point s in the same spot, changing the origin of the vector.

Apply this

Each complex factor can be expressed as a vector of magnitude $M$ and angle $\theta$
