While the machine had no meaningful purpose, I had to manage working with engineers from multiple backgrounds and specialties. One of the main problems I encountered is effective team utilisation. Identifying and utilising skills from other team members is tricky, not properly delegating tasks or poor communication channels can lead to wasted potential and wasted workload.
