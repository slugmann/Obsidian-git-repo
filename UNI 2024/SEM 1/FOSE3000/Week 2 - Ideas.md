**Pavegen**
Developed by Laurence Kemball-Cook Founder
- Depth of travel around **5-10mm**
- Each step generates **about 2 to 4 joules**

Being generous

10,000 customer walk through the door each day (lower end of the range for a mid sized super market)
assuming 2 joules per step and an unavoidable strip of tiles 3 steps wide
6 steps per customer (entering and leaving)
$$10,000*6 = 60,000$$
$$60,0000*2 = 120,000$$
$$\text{over the course of a day, assuming 8am to 8pm }$$

- **Triangular** design to maximise generation (more torque?)
- Uses **electromagnetism** (what about piezo?)
