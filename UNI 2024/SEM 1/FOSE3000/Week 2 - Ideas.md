**Pavegen**
Developed by Laurence Kemball-Cook Founder
- Depth of travel around **5-10mm**
- Each step generates **about 2 to 4 joules**

Being generous

10,000 customer walk through the door each day (lower end of the range for a mid sized super market)
assuming 2 joules per step and an unavoidable strip of tiles 3 steps wide
6 steps per customer (entering and leaving)

- **Triangular** design to maximise generation (more torque?)
- Uses **electromagnetism** (what about piezo?)
