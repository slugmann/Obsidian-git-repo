​￼￼￼Which flesh is yours?

​￼￼￼Mad Nettle
These knight's origins are unknown. Some believe they're some kind of cult, others claim they are the mindless servants of a long dead god. 

Deadly poisonous spikes erupt from their plate armour at odd angles.
Manacles about their wrists, secured with stakes through the forearms, make it impossible for them to wield traditional weapons.

​￼￼￼Murk Sage
Wielders of incredible mind twisting powers, Murk Sages warp the minds of both friend and foe alike. The metal dome encasing their heads act as a conduit for their power. 

As their conduit becomes more damaged, their abilities become more unpredictable and erratic. Many Sages are driven mad by the voices that reverberate about their skull.

​￼￼￼Ancient Glory
An old warrior, veteran of countless battles. Now a lost soul, cursed to wander the earth till they are cut down by an equal. Ancient magic traps the life in their bones.

Ew subject to debilitating injuries. They may only pass on in the heat of battle.

​￼￼￼Stone Scholar
Stones bound to their heads crush and pierce their skulls, leaving them in constant pain. Through this sacrifice, they are favoured by the gods, and are granted forbidden wisdom.

Experts in mud sorcery, these scholars wield the earth itself against their enemies. Their sacrifice grants them great knowledge, although their weakened state renders them worthless in a brawl.
