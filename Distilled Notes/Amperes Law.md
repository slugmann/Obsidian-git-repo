**Ampere's Law:** Since a current produces and magnetic field, the line integral of magnetic field intensity H equals total enclosed current.

$\oint H * d l = \sum\limits i$     $\sum\limits_{k}H_{k}l_{k}=\sum\limits_{m}N_{m}i_{m}$
	^ line integral of H

**Magneto Motive Force (MMF)**
$H_{1}l_{1}+H_{g}l_{g} = N_{1}i_{1}$
