*The pressure in a confined fluid is transmitted equally to the whole surface of its container.*

I a downward force is applied to piston A it will be transmitted through the system to Piston B

Fluid pressure is measured in terms of the force exerted per unit area.
$$P = \frac{F_{1}}{A_{1}}=\frac{F_{2}}{A_{2}}$$
We can re-arrange this to determine any given variable with
