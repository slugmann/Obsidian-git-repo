# Magnetic Circuits
### Amperes Law: Current Through Conductor
Current $(i)$ flowing through a conductor will induce a magnetic field with strength $(H)$ at radius $(r)$ .

$$\int H.dl = \sum i = Ni$$
$$H = \frac{i}{2\pi r}$$
Where r is the distance of the point from the conductor

### Amperes Law: Coil around a core

$$H = \frac{Ni}{2\pi r}$$
Magnetic circuits also follow Ampere's Law, the sum of flux entering and exiting a point must be equal to zero.
