**Power Output = Power input - Losses**

# Power Input
$P_{in}=V_{dc}I_{dc}$     For a DC motor
$P_{in}= V_{ph}I_{ph}\cos\phi$     For a single phase motor
$P_{in}= 3 V_{ph}I_{ph}\cos \phi = \sqrt{3}V_{in}I_{in}\cos\phi$     For a 3 Phase Motor

Where: $\phi$ Is the phase angle between phase voltage and current.

# Power Output
$$T_{out}=\omega_{m}T_{m} = \frac{2\pi NT_{m}}{60}$$
Where $N$ is in RPM.

# Efficiency
$$\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}$$
Pretty simple, #todo Add more

## Losses
$I^{2}R$ *loss* (*Copper loss*): Motor winding (both in stator and rotor)

*Magnetic loss*: Combination of eddy current and hysteresis loss

*Friction and windage loss*: Also known as rotational loss or mechanical loss.

# Induction Motors
