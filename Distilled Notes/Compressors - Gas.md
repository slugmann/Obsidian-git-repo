Compresses gas from a low inlet pressure (usually atmosphere) to a higher desired pressure. This is done with a cam and piston to physically compress the gas.

Air capacity of air compressors are generally rated at atmospheric conditions. Equation used for the calculation is $$V1=\frac{p2*V2*T1}{p1*T2}$$
Power required to drive compressors:
$$kW Required = \frac{p_{in}Q}{17.1}[(p_{in}/p_{out})^{0.286}-1]$$
$p_{in}$ is the inlet atmospheric pressure (psia, kPa abs)
$p_{out}$ is the outlet atmospheric pressure (psia, kPa abs)
$Q$ is the flow rate (SCFM. standard m3/min)'
