**Factor the bottom**
$$\frac{5x-4}{x^{2}-x-2} = \frac{5x-4}{(x-2)(x+1)}$$

**Write one partial fraction for each factor of the denominator**
$$\frac{5x-4}{(x-2)(x+1)} = \frac{A_{1}}{x-2} + \frac{A_{2}}{x+1}$$

**Multiply by the denominator**
$$5x-4 = A_{1} (x+1) + A_{2} (x-2)$$

solve at roots of denominator terms for A_1 and A_2.
