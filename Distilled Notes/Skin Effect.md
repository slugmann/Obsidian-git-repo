The [Skin Effect](.md) is the tendency of an AC current to **distribute current within a conductor** such that the **current density is largest near the surface**. 
This current decreases exponentially as we approach the centre. **The effect becomes greater at higher frequencies**

$$\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega \mu \sigma}}$$
$$\sigma = \frac{1}{\rho}$$
$$\omega = 2\pi f$$
$$\mu = \mu_{0}\mu_{r}$$
