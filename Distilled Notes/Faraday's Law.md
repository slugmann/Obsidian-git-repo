# Coil in Magnetic Field
An alternating current produces alternating magnetic flux. If the variable flux is linked to a coil, an EMF is induced in it.
$$\epsilon  =-N \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}$$

N = number of turns of coil
# Coil Around a Core:
$v(t)$ induced by a change in flux $\Phi (t)$

**One turn**
$$v_{turn}(t) = \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}$$

**N Turns**
$$v(t) = n \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}$$
