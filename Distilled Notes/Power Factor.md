In electrical engineering, the power factor of an AC system is the expression of energy efficiency. The **power factor (PF)** is defined as the ratio of **active power (measured in Watts)** to *the apparent power (measured in VA)*.

The power factor expresses the ratio of **true power which is used in an AC circuit** to *the total power that can be delivered to the circuit*. Mathematically, the power factor can be expressed using the following formula −

$$Powerfactor=\frac{Activepower}{Apparentpower}$$

There are two major terms are associated with the power factor of an AC circuit viz. **Lagging** and **Leading**. These two terms show the relation between the current and voltage in the circuit.

# Leading

In an AC system, when load current leads (or advances in phase) the supply voltage, then the load is said to have a **leading power factor**. *In practice, the **capacitive loads cause a leading power factor**, i.e. a leading power factor signifies that the load is capacitive as the load will deliver reactive power.*

The leading power factor can also be described as the load current that attains its peak value up to 90° ahead of the voltage. **A leading power factor also means that the same voltage across the load terminals can be maintained with a lower internal induced voltage**. An *inductive load is used to correct the leading power factor.*


# Lagging
When the load current lags behind the supply voltage, then the load is said to have **lagging power factor**. In other words, power factor of the load is said to be lagging if the **current waveform is behind the voltage waveform**.

The **lagging power factor of the load signifies that the load is inductive** and it will consume reactive power. The lagging power factor can also be described as the **load current that attains its peak value upto 90° later of the voltage**. In order to correct the lagging power factor capacitive loads are employed.

# Difference between Leading and Lagging
| Parameter                 | Lagging Power Factor                                                                                                                   | Leading Power Factor                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition                | For a given load, if the load current lags behind the voltage, then the power factor of the load is called lagging power factor.       | For a given load, if the load current leads or advances in phase the voltage, then the load power factor is called leading power factor. |
| Nature of Load            | The lagging power in an AC electric circuit is caused by the inductive loads such as induction motors, etc.                            | In an AC electric circuit, the capacitive loads cause a leading power factor.                                                            |
| Power factor value        | The value of lagging power exists between -1 and 0. Here, the "-ve" sign have significance in case of digital meters only.             | The value of leading power factor exists between 0 and 1.                                                                                |
| Power factor angle        | For lagging power factor, the phase angle of current is negative with respect to the phase angle of voltage.                           | In case of leading power factor, the phase angle of current is positive with respect to the phase angle of voltage.                      |
| Reactive power component  | For lagging power factor, the reactive component is negative.                                                                          | The reactive power component is positive for a load of leading power factor.                                                             |
| Reactive power absorption | When the power factor of the load is lagging, then it absorbs lagging reactive power or we can say it delivers leading reactive power. | When the load have leading power factor, then it absorbs leading reactive power (or delivers lagging reactive power).                    |
| Power factor correction   | **A poor lagging power factor can be improved by adding a capacitive load in the circuit.**                                                | **A poor leading power factor can be corrected by adding an inductive load in the circuit.**                                                 |
| Examples of loads         | The loads of lagging power factor are inductive loads such as inductors, transformers, electromagnetic relays, induction motors, etc.  | The capacitive loads have leading power factor, the common examples are overexcited synchronous motor, capacitors, radio circuits, etc.  |
